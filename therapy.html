            <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The industry of the oVRcome business is the HealthTech industry, which focuses on developing technology that improves healthcare outcomes and efficiency.

            <h2>Role in my Organization</h2> 
        <p> 
            My role in the organization would be of Technical Support. I would deal with providing technical support for users, which could be ensuring proper VR headset setup or troubleshooting any issues users may have with the program.

        <div>
            <h2>Possible Ethical Issue</h2>
            <p>
                One possible ethical issue that could arise in the organization would be of data privacy, as the VR systems could record data on a users personal surroundings along with collecting sensitive data like biometric data. 
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Possible Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
            <p>
                One possible cybersecurity isue that could arise within the organization would be a data breach of user's personal data like biometric data and payment information which could lead to identity theft and financial loss. Another cybersecurity issue that could arise in the organization is malware infecting VR software for users which could lead to system damages or theft of information if the malware spreads to the user's devices.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Best Cybersecurity Practices</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the best cybersecurity practices that we could follow to protect ourselves and users would be to encrypt all sensitive data and anonymize biometric data to protect user privacy. We could also keep VR applications and software up to date with security patches and enable a multi-factor authentication system to protect all accounts. Another practice we could use would be to implement constant monitioring to detect any anomalies in user behavior and system perfomance before something bad happens.
