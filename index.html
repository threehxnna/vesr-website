            <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p>
            Integrity is important to me because it makes things easier when you can be trusted to do the right thing even when nobody is around to keep you in check. I got this value from my parents, as they would teach me to act responsibly even when they aren't around.

        <div>
            <h2>Respect</h2> 
        <p> 
            Respect is important to me because I feel like everyone should treat others with respect, just as they would want other people to treat themselves respectfully. I also got this value from my parents, as it was imperative to treat them with respect if I wanted them to also treat me with respect.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Selflessness</h2>
            <p>
                Selflessness is important to me because I believe that the world doesn't revolve around you, and that in some instances, you could prioritize the betterment of others over yourself. I got this value from helping my friends with their mental health when I could have a lot on my own plate.
